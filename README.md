# Learning OpenCV in Python

I have done a course in Digital Image Processing from NPTEL, and I found the topic far more  interesting as expected from it`s reputation. But we cant learn only from theory, we need to implement them too ! I have found this particular video  very helpful.

I have included all the chapters in the git folder.
Happy Learning! 


I have saved the processed images  in the Saved Images, and the lena(picture) and flower(video) in the Test Images.
